<strong>Passage 1 : Start!</strong>

    This summer, I will go toBeijingNewOrientalSchoolto study English.
    Today, July 12th,2011, my trip would start. I went to Laiwu Bus Station at 5:30. Then, at 6:10, the bus was launching. An hour later, the bus had been in Taian Bus Station. Next, I went to Taishan Railway Station immediately. But unfortunately, when I was in station, the station radio said the train which went toBeijingwould be late about 40 minutes. Finally, at 9:40, a man told me the train which had been late was checking.<!--more-->
    After two hours, the train had been in Beijing Railway Station.
    Now ,I’m in my sister’s Home!

<strong>Passage 2: The first English Class</strong>
    Today is July 15th; my first English Class inNewOrientalSchoolwill begin.
    Because I played computer until 11:00p.m. yesterday, I’m late for my first day about 40 minutes. When I went to classroom, it’s already 8:40.My teacher asked me to chose a seat to sit. Then, she tell us her name is Jewel. She is a very young teacher, but she is a knowledgeable teacher. Then, everyone instruction himself/herself to others. I know my desk mate’s name is Aim Kang, she comes from Fangshan.
    Today, my English teacher tells us something about English, they’re very useful. For example, if we want our parents to sit, we should say”Please be seated” or “Have a seat” instead of  “Sit down, please”.
    From this class, I realized English is very interesting, and I want to learn more about it.
